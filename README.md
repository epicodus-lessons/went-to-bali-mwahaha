# README

E-commerce site. Uses `bcrypt` and `materialize`. There's a seed file. Set up your own admin. If you have questions, I'll be in Bali with no email. Ask someone else.

To set up:

* `rake db:setup`

* Sorry, didn't get around to tests. It mostly works. There might be a few bugs.

## Description

This application is for both customers (users) and Store managers (admins).  It includes `bcrypt` and `materialize`.

Users can:
- Create an account
- Login/Logout of their account
- View all products on one page
- Add items to their shopping cart
- Visit their shopping cart to view total price and/or remove items from their cart

Admins can:
- Add, edit, or delete products
- Delete user reviews
* Note: There is one admin seeded in the database.  An admin can only be added by seeding the database to prevent any user from accessing admin functionality.  To access the admin account, login using:

Email: "admin@admin.com"
Password: "password123456"

The application structure is outlined below.  

Models:
  - Users
